##Introduction:

Define the end purpose/ objective of this exercise.
    - Determine the profitablity of the transactions
        - Clearly identify the Revenues
        - Determine the total costs:
            - Cost of good sold
            - Shipping
            - Taxes
        - Report:
            Profitablity:
                Revenues
                Cost of Goods Sold
                Gross Margin
                Operating Costs:
                    Shipping
                    Taxes
                Net profit
            Top Customers

Determine the sources of data required to perform the anlaysis
    - All data is internally sourced.

Evaluating the data to:
    - Understand the nature of the undlying data and if its fit for purpose
    - Determine the extent of data cleaning required and clean up if needed.
        - Missing data
        - Performing calculations to prepare the exising data for the end purpose.

Analize the data
    - Performing the calculations required to generate:
        - Overall profitablity report
        - Customer profitablity report
        
Results and observations
    - Report of profitablity and Top Customers
    - Observations regarding the qualit of customers and/or thier profitablity 
        - Number of orders vs volume of individual purchases.
